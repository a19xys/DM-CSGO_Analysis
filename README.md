# Dataset analysis for knowledge discovery

This analysis will address some of the most important aspects of the knowledge discovery process from data, including:

- Data storage and loading
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Model validation

To achieve this goal, we will manipulate and visualize the data using various functions in the Plotly library. We will also use classification algorithms such as decision trees using the Scikit-learn library.

Our goal will be to load, explore, and prepare our data, learn and validate different classification models, and be able to interpret the results. To achieve this, we will use the following dataset:
